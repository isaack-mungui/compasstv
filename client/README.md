# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Pre-Prerequisites
======================================================================
You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

- node >= 18
- npm >= 8
To install the above, I highly recommend using a node version manager (i.e. https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

Setup
=====================================================================
`Javascript
npm install
`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
